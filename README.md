# VBA Challenge
### A homework assignment from the University of Birmingham Data Analytics Bootcamp (November 2021)

The aim of this project was to create scripts that analyse two separate files:
 - Headline metrics extracted from a monthly budget data file
 - Individual candidate results extracted from an election data file

### Results
There are three .py files in this repository. [Main.py](https://github.com/J-Fairgrieve/python-challenge/blob/main/main.py) contains both scripts for overall reference, but coding for the individual files can be found at the following:

 - [budget-script.py](https://github.com/J-Fairgrieve/python-challenge/blob/main/budget-script.py)
 - [poll-script.py](https://github.com/J-Fairgrieve/python-challenge/blob/main/poll-script.py)

### budget-script.py
 - Number of months in file
 - Total Profit/Loss
 - Average month on month change
 - Greatest increase in profits
 - Greatest decrease in profits (Largest loss)
 - Results are printed to terminal & [.txt file](https://github.com/J-Fairgrieve/python-challenge/blob/main/Analysis/Budget_Analysis.txt)

### poll-script.py
 - Total votes
 - Individual candidate performance (# votes and % share of vote)
 - Winner
 - Results are printed to terminal & [.txt file](https://github.com/J-Fairgrieve/python-challenge/blob/main/Analysis/Poll_Analysis.txt)
